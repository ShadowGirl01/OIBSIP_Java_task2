# OIBSIP Java Task 2 â€“ Guess the Number Game

Hi! I'm **Vanshika Saini**, a BCA student at **Uttaranchal University**, and this is my submission for the **Oasis Infobyte Java Internship â€“ Task 2**.

I've developed a fun and interactive **Number Guessing Game** using **Java (JDK 24)** and `JOptionPane` for a simple GUI. The game challenges users to guess a random number between 1 and 100 within 6 attempts, with feedback, scoring, and replay features built in.


## Project Objective

- Guess the number generated by the computer (range: 1â€“100)
- Maximum of **6 attempts** per round
- Feedback after each guess: *"Too High"*, *"Too Low"*, or *"Correct!"*
- Earn points based on attempts left
- Option to play multiple rounds
- Cumulative score tracking


## Tools & Technologies Used

- ðŸ”¸ Java (JDK 24)
- ðŸ”¸ Swing GUI (`JOptionPane`)
- ðŸ”¸ VS Code (Visual Studio Code)
- ðŸ”¸ GitHub for version control and hosting


## How It Works

1. The system randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
2. User inputs their guess through a GUI pop-up.
3. The game responds with hints (too high / too low).
4. The round ends when the user guesses right or runs out of attempts.
5. User sees their **round score** and **total score**.
6. Option to play again is shown after each round.
